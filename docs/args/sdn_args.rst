SDN Arguments
==============

A software-defined network (SDN) controller serves as the intelligent command center of the network. It centralizes
decision-making processes and uses software to dictate how network traffic should flow. This documentation page
provides insights into the essential arguments and parameters used to configure and manage the SDN controller
effectively.
